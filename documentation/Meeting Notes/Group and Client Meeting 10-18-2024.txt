Meeting questions: 

- Having a single system where we can put all of our docs / work / appointments 
- Discussing LLM's with professors (Jonathan going next week to discuss) 
- Sally Bass update + Wiki on Cyber Range (do we want to schedule a meeting with her) 
- Narrowing down an idea? 

Ripken got some tips with the RMF: 

NIST 800-53r5 Chapter 3 - all of the controls that should be continuous 

Kitsap credit union bank RMF procedure?  
What area do we want to target the RMF procedures? 

"Help me plan and scope an RMF" 
	- look into more applied scenarios  

Setting up a meeting with Sally bass to see what the best way of doing this is 



Game plan: 

- Getting into contact with Sally to set up a meeting with the Cyber Range 
- More research over the weekend (RMF, OS Hardware choices), work to narrow down what it is that we want 
- Re-group Sunday night or Monday morning to follow up with client
